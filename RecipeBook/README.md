This application will keep track of recipes in a recipe book, storing the recipe name, its food type/s, ingredients, 
instructions, difficulty, and whether or not the dish has been made. I plan to add additional funcion later on such as
a common ingredient searcher and a function that allows quantities to be multiplied 
or divided in a recipe. I plan to share this program with my mom since she usually cooks back home, and now for myself 
too since I now cook for myself. This project is of interest to me because now that I am in 2nd year
there is no more meal plan, and I've started cooking for myself, and always planning to write down the recipes I cook 
in a notebook. I've never gotten to it but now that I'm making this program I can store it in an organized manner in my
laptop.
